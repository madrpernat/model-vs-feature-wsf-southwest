    Run Forward Feature Selection (FFS) across all basins and model types.

    For each basin:
        - Load the basin's featureâ€“target dataset and the basin's candidate feature set
        - Run FFS for each regressor
            - Track model performance (RRMSE, NSE) at each iteration

        - Individual CSVs for each basin-regressor combination with skill scores (RRMSE, NSE) at each iteration
        - One CSV per basin showing the order in which each feature was selected for each regressor
